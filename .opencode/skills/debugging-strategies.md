# Claude Code Debugging Strategies

## What This Skill Does

Provides debugging approaches specifically tailored for AI-assisted development environments like Claude Code.

## AI-Assisted Debugging

### 1. Contextual Debugging
- Share relevant code snippets
- Provide clear error messages
- Include environment details
- Describe expected vs actual behavior

### 2. Iterative Problem Solving
```
Step 1: Describe the problem
Step 2: AI suggests hypotheses
Step 3: Test each hypothesis
Step 4: Validate the solution
```

### 3. Pattern Recognition
- Identify recurring issues
- Learn from past solutions
- Build debugging playbooks
- Document common fixes

## Strategies

### Divide and Conquer
1. Isolate the problem area
2. Test components independently
3. Narrow down the scope
4. Identify root cause

### Hypothesis-Driven
1. Form educated guesses
2. Test systematically
3. Document results
4. Refine approach

### Rubber Ducking with AI
- Explain the problem to AI
- Answer clarifying questions
- Discover hidden assumptions
- Find blind spots

## Claude Code Specific

### Effective Prompting
```
"Debug this function: [code]
Expected: [expected behavior]
Actual: [actual behavior]
Error: [error message if any]"
```

### Tool Integration
- Use /debug command effectively
- Leverage code analysis tools
- Utilize test runners
- Apply linters and formatters

### Workflow Optimization
- Set up reproducible environments
- Use version control effectively
- Maintain clear documentation
- Track debugging sessions
