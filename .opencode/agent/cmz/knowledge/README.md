# CMZ Knowledge Base

## Overview
This directory contains the learning knowledge base for CMZ (Cognitive Machine Zero) agent.

## Structure

### patterns/
Stores successful patterns identified from code analysis and execution.

### errors/
Tracks errors encountered and their resolutions for self-healing capabilities.

### decisions/
Records significant architectural and implementation decisions.

### learnings/
Continuous accumulation of insights from interactions and codebase study.

## Integration with Supplements

CMZ learns from the following supplemental repositories:

1. **oh-my-opencode** - Agent orchestration patterns and multi-model strategies
2. **superpowers** - Systematic debugging approaches and development workflows
3. **AI-Agents-public** - Shared skills and git commit message patterns
4. **system_prompts_leaks** - Effective prompt engineering patterns
5. **UltraRAG** - Advanced RAG implementation strategies
6. **opencode-antigravity-auth** - Security and authentication best practices

## Usage

- Files are automatically updated by CMZ during post-execution hooks
- Patterns are analyzed and stored for future reference
- Error history informs prevention strategies
- Decisions are documented with context and reasoning
